          <small className="text-red-600 font-bold uppercase">Question 1:</small>
          <h1 className="font-bold text-xl mb-4">How would you manually migrate a WordPress website? Do note that on your server you
            have full SSH access and the source server is a typical shared CPanel hosting.</h1>
          <small className="text-blue-600 font-bold uppercase">Answer:</small>
          <p>I would use the FTP access included with all CPanel plans. I would archive the directory containing the WordPress website and then use FTP software like FileZilla or Transmit for exmaple, download the archive and move upload/extract it to the new server or location.</p>

        <article className="border border-slate-800 rounded p-4 w-full">
          <small className="text-red-600 font-bold uppercase">Question 2:</small>
          <h1 className="font-bold text-xl mb-4">Unfortunately, after the migration, it seems that some folders have passed with the
            wrong ownership. Our user:group is www-data:www-data. What actions should be
            taken?</h1>
          <small className="text-blue-600 font-bold uppercase">Answer:</small>
          <p>If I have SSH access on the server I would SSH in and `cd` into the WordPress directory and run the following command `sudo chown -R www-data:www-data .` but if I do not have SSH access then I will use the file management section in CPanel to fix the ownership permissions using the "Change Permission" or "Permission" option in the menu. Though SSH I would highly recommend.</p>

          <small className="text-red-600 font-bold uppercase">Question 3:</small>
          <h1 className="font-bold text-xl mb-4">A website seems to be down, server resources are high and the website is most likely
            infected. How would you identify if itâ€™s an infection and possible ways of clearing it up?</h1>
          <small className="text-blue-600 font-bold uppercase">Answer:</small>
          <p>For this, I would check for unauthorized or suspicious code in the website&apos;s files and remove them. I would scan through the code to see if any odd changes were made and remove any code that was inserted. I would also look at logs to see if I can identify how the malicious code or so got in.</p>

          <h1 className="font-bold text-xl mb-4">Briefly explain How would you swap the domain of the main site of the multisite with a
            subsite of the same multisite.</h1>
          <small className="text-blue-600 font-bold uppercase">Answer:</small>
          <p>I would do the following</p>
          <ol>
            <li>1. Backup the database</li>
            <li>2. Update the &quot;siteurl&quot; and &quot;home&quot; values in the wp_options table for both sites.</li>
            <li>3. Update the domain mapping in the site&apos;s settings.</li>
            <li>4. Update the .htaccess file with the new domain.</li>
            <li>5. Update the DNS settings for the domains.</li>
            <li>and update any SSL certificates with the new domain. Granted this process can vary depending on server setup.</li>

          <small className="text-red-600 font-bold uppercase">Question 6:</small>
          <h1 className="font-bold text-xl mb-4">The obvious answer between HTTP and HTTPS is HTTPS. But what would be needed in
            terms of files and data to install a certificate on a server?</h1>
          <small className="text-blue-600 font-bold uppercase">Answer:</small>
          <p>This can be done in a couple ways. Either an SSL certificate is purchased or the more common way (For me at least) would be to use LetsEncrypt free certificates which need a renewal every 3 months. I would then install the certificate on the server and update the nginx configuration to use the certificate. I would also need to ensure port 443 is open. This is something I do often with my Ruby on Rails sites using Nginx and I have a cronjob that handles auto renewal.</p>

            /var/web/site/public_html/wp-includes/functions.php on line 4552</b> . What would this
            error mean and how could it be resolved?</h1>
          <small className="text-blue-600 font-bold uppercase">Answer:</small>
          <p>It typically means that the allowed memory is at capacity. One way to fix it would be to increase the limit in the php.ini or using .htaccess ex: `php_value memory_limit 256M`</p>

            the Nginx rules to redirect them to the homepage.</h1>
          <small className="text-blue-600 font-bold uppercase">Answer:</small>
          <p>This can be done with one rule that uses regular expression:</p>

            you handle this? Make a reply to the user</h1>
          <small className="text-blue-600 font-bold uppercase">Answer:</small>
          <p>I would inform them that is is a security risk to make files/folders full permission and I would try to get more details to help offer a different approach if possible. However, if absolutely needed then I would update the permissions for them from the File Manager or in terminal with the `chmod` command</p>
